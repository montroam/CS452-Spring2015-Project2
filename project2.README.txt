ALLISON MONTROY, SARAH SELBY, 4/25/15, PROJECT 2

We worked off of our original game, brought it into 3D, 
and changed it so that you now get points for running into the shapes rather than avoiding them.

The controls are WASD, and are used to move L-R, and UP-DOWN.

The score increases whenever you run into a shape/ or it runs through you. 

The goals of the game is to see how high of a score you can get in approx. 60s.
